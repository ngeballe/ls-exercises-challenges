- input: a 3x4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces (Trinary number)
- output: a string of numbers

- singular number
    + representation of each number, 0 - 9
    + lookup
    + return '?' for invalid input

- multiple numbers--n numbers
    - need to convert grid of (3 * n) * 4 into n grids of (3 x 4)
        + bring a 3*n string into n groups of 3 characters: String#scan
        + break into multiples of (3 x 4) array groups
 
- multiple rows of numbers
    + divide into multiple single rows
    + use the solution for step above

- Implementation:
    + how to represent an OCR number
    + " _\n| |\n|_|\n" => 0
    + or w/o newlines " _| ||_|" => 0
